# MyBnbProgram

MyBnb,	a	property	sharing	startup,	is	planning	to	launch	new	rental	services	by segmenting	the	properties	regarding	their	standards.	More	specifically,	the	properties are	separated	into	three	categories,	i.e.	apartments,	houses	and	luxury	villas.	All properties	have	common	info,	i.e.	unique register	number,	owner’s	name,	postal address,	rental	cost	per	day,	total	number	of	season’s	rental	days.	The	apartment	has as additional	info	the	storey number	and	number	of	beds.	The	house	has	as	additional info the	total	number	of	storeys	and	the	clearing	fees.	The	luxury	villa	has	as	additional info the	total	number	of	rooms,	the	room	service	cost	per	day	and	luxury	tax	per	day. MyBnb	wants	to	develop	a	Java	program that	will	handle	the	whole	business using input and	output	text	files.
